# Calculator Commands

We've discussed numbers, fractional, scientific notation, and decimal, as well as operands that perform basic mathematical functions. This chapter starts discussing commands
which are the heart of RPNCalc.

Calculator Commands are the basic commands that operations on the numbers you've placed on the stack. Most are fairly simple and intuitive, but there are a few that are a bit
odd. I'm looking at you `dice`.

These commands, like the others you'll read about later, are executed by typing the command name, and any needed arguments into RPNCalc. Often there are several different
names and abbreviations for the same command. This is just to make it easier to remember. Brackets, `[]` around an option denotes it is optional.

| aa [keep]<br>addall [keep]             | **ADD ALL**<br>Add all stack items together and replace the numbers on the stack with the result.  If the optional `keep` parameter is sent, the elements added will be retained on the stack and the total will be added to the top of the stack.  The entire `keep` command is not necessary, anything that starts with `k` will work                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| abs                                    | **ABSOLUTE VALUE**<br>Takes the [absolute value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_value#:~:text=In%20mathematics%2C%20the%20absolute%20value,and%20%7C0%7C%20%3D%200) of line 1.  The returns the positive value of the number.  Not the most useful command on it's own as you can always `f` flip the sign.  However it could be useful as part of a User Defined Function                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| avg [keep]<br>mean [keep]              | **AVERAGE / MEAN**<br>Calculate the [average](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Average) of all of the numbers on the stack.  The stack will be replaced with the result.  If `keep` is provided, the stack will be retained and the average will be added on top. `average` or `mean` can also be used                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| c <br> clear                           | **CLEAR**<br>Clear the current stack and the screen.  Memory data is retained and you can undo the clear with the undo `u` command                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

Used to remove the clutter                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| copy [#] <br> dup [#]                  | **COPY**<br>With no number provided, copy will duplicate the top stack item / `line1` and place it on the stack.  If the optional line number is given, the value at that line will be duplicated to the top of the stack. A negative number may also be provided which will be a relative reference.  For example, if `-1` is provided, the `line2` value will be copied.  This is very useful when the command is used during the creation of a User Defined Function and the amount of numbers on the stack is unknown                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| d<br>d [#]<br>d [#-#]<br>del<br>delete | **DELETE**<br>If `d` is given without any parameters, it will delete `line1`.  If a line number is given after the `d`, that line number will be deleted.  A range can be given as well, such as `d 1-3` and RPNCalc will delete those lines and everything in between.  A negative number can also be provided which is a relative reference.  `-1` will delete the value one behind the current top of the stack value.

This makes the point that remainder is different than modulus. The remainder is given by `subtract(this.divideToIntegralValue(divisor).multiply(divisor))` Note that this is not the modulo operation as the result can be negative                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

If `keep` is provided, the numbers on the stack will not be removed and the standard deviation will simply be added to the top of the stack on `line1`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| sort a\|d                              | **SORT**<br>Sort the stack in an ascending or descending way.  An `a` or `d` is required.  You can provide `ascending` or `descending` if you like, but only the first letter is looked at (just like `keep` in other commands.) Note that this might look reversed at first since the top of the stack is `line1` which is the bottom of the display.  If you get it wrong just `undo` and sort the other way                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

| u [#]<br> undo [#]                     | **UNDO**<br>By default, undo the last operation.  However, if an undo stack line number is given, as displayed with the `list undo` command, undo will restore the stack back to that point.  Please keep in mind that if you restore back to a previous undo state, later undo states will be discarded.  You can't go back. Typically, however, `u` undo is used to simply undo the previous action                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
