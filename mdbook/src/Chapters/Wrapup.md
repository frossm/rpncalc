# Wrapup

Well, if you've read this far you probably know more about RPNCalc than I do. I needed a command line based RPN calculator and have been very happy with this one. I've added
features as I've needed them and use it daily for many years now. Some time ago I decided to make the program, source, and documentation available so others could use it if
they wished. For those that have, I hope you found it useful.

I'll continue to add new features as I think about them. If you have suggestions, issues, or ideas, the links to reach out to me. Details are on the Introduction page.

Best wishes and happy reverse Polish notation calculating...
